<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our repositories on GitHub are primarily for development of the project and tracking active issues. Most of the information you will find here pertains to setting up the project for development purposes and is not relevant to the end-user.

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not use this decompilation project without providing your own legally purchased copy of the game.** We do not distribute any assets from the game - you must use your own legitimately obtained PS2 copy of the game. We support every retail PAL, NTSC, and NTSC-J build, including Greatest Hits copies.

Welcome to the openGOAL Modbase! This project is designed to give modders a comprehensive foundation for creating mods for the openGOAL framework. Whether you're looking to improve existing mods or build something entirely new, this modbase provides the essential tools, resources, and documentation to get you started.

Here's why the openGOAL Modbase is perfect for modders:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* Creating GOAL code is hard, running it shouldn't be.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* With a focus on simplicity, modbase helps you get up and running quickly, even if you have little to no programming experience.
* Thanks to the openGOAL community, this modbase is always evolving. You can contribute, suggest features, or create pull requests to make it even better. :smile:

For more information, visit jakmods.dev, or check out the documentation to learn more about how to get started and make the most out of this project.
Feel free to fork this repo, suggest changes, or open issues to help improve the openGOAL Modbase. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to making this project better!
